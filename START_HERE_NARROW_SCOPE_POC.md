# ðŸš€ Klaviyo Reporting POC - Narrow Scope Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-06

## Overview

This document serves as the starting point for implementing the narrow scope POC for automating Klaviyo report generation via Looker Studio. The implementation is divided into 6 sequential PRs, each building on the previous one.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan is detailed in `docs/NARROW_SCOPE_POC_PR_PLAN.md`. This document outlines the 6 PRs that need to be implemented:

1. **PR 1: Klaviyo API Ingest Script** - Create a script to fetch campaign metrics from the Klaviyo API
2. **PR 2: LookML Field Mapper** - Normalize Klaviyo fields for Looker Studio
3. **PR 3: Mock Looker Dataset** - Create a mock dataset for testing
4. **PR 4: Test Visualization Stub** - Create a sample Looker Studio JSON config
5. **PR 5: ETL Runner** - Integrate fetch â†’ normalize â†’ export
6. **PR 6: README Updates** - Document the POC pipeline

## Implementation Guides

Detailed implementation guides for each PR are available in the `docs/` directory:

- `docs/PR1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PR2_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PR3_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PR4_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PR5_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/PR6_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

Each guide contains:
- Complete code snippets and examples
- Unit tests
- Validation steps for both developers and reviewers
- Clear instructions for implementation and testing

## Directory Structure

The narrow scope POC should follow this directory structure:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ klaviyo_api_ingest.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lookml_field_mapper.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ etl_runner.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_klaviyo_api_ingest.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_lookml_field_mapper.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_etl_runner.py
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mock_looker_dataset.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_visualization_stub.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Implementation Process

1. **Create a new branch for each PR**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/pr1-klaviyo-api-ingest
   ```

2. **Implement the code according to the implementation guide**:
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions in the guide
   - Implement all required functionality
   - Add unit tests as specified

3. **Validate your implementation**:
   - Run the validation steps listed in the implementation guide
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Verify that the code meets the requirements

4. **Create a PR**:
   - Push your branch to GitHub
   - Create a PR with a title that matches the PR title in the plan
   - Include a reference to the implementation plan in the PR description

5. **Move to the next PR after the current one is merged**

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each PR should include unit tests for all functionality
- **Integration Tests**: PR 5 (ETL Runner) should include integration tests for the end-to-end flow
- **Mock Data**: Use mock data for testing to avoid dependencies on external services

## Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions
- Include examples in README.md
- Document known limitations and future enhancements

## Next Steps

1. Start with PR 1: Klaviyo API Ingest Script
2. Follow the implementation guide in `docs/PR1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
3. Create a PR when implementation is complete
4. Continue with PR 2 after PR 1 is merged
