# .env Debug and Fix Documentation

## Problem

The end-to-end test failed with:
```
[2025-05-07 00:03:58] Loading environment variables from .env file
/Users/tdeshane/clara-strategy-session/klaviyo-reporting-poc/.env: line 63: Metrics: command not found
```

This error suggests that a line in `.env` was not in `KEY=VALUE` format, possibly something like:
```
Metrics: ...
```

## Solution

1. **Reviewed `.env` file:**
   - All lines are now in `KEY=VALUE` format.
   - No stray colons or markdown/table lines present.
2. **If error recurs:**
   - Check for lines that do not match `KEY=VALUE` (especially lines starting with a colon or with no `=`).
   - Remove or comment out those lines.
3. **After fix:**
   - Save `.env` and rerun the end-to-end test.

## Outcome
- The error should be resolved if `.env` contains only valid `KEY=VALUE` lines.
- If you still see errors, check for hidden characters or copy-paste artifacts.

## Reference
- This fix was documented after a failed end-to-end test run and verified by reviewing the current `.env` file.
