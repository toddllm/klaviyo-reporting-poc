# Branch Cleanup Solution

## Problem

The repository had accumulated several branches that were already merged via Pull Requests but hadn't been deleted. This creates clutter and makes it harder to identify active work.

## Analysis

After examining the repository, I found:

1. Several existing scripts for branch cleanup:
   - `cleanup_branches.py` - A Python script using GitHub CLI to identify branches with merged PRs
   - `scripts/cleanup_branches.sh` - A Bash script identifying branches merged into main
   - `scripts/custom_cleanup.sh` - A Bash script with a hardcoded list of branches to keep

2. The existing scripts had limitations:
   - They required interactive user input
   - They were timing out when executed in the current environment

3. The repository had several local branches that corresponded to merged PRs:
   - `feature/ai-insights-20250502` (PR #24 - merged)
   - `feature/cleanup-merged-branches-and-open-prs-20250502-163521` (PR #22 - merged)
   - `feature/read-start-here-md-and-create-next-pr-20250502-161039` (multiple merged PRs)
   - `fix/pr-labeling` (PR #21 - merged)

## Solution

I created a new script `scripts/efficient_cleanup.sh` that:

1. Identifies branches that have been merged based on PR history
2. Preserves important branches (current branch, main, and potential WIP branches)
3. Deletes the identified merged branches locally
4. Checks for and deletes corresponding remote branches if they exist
5. Generates a cleanup report documenting the actions taken

## Results

The script successfully cleaned up the repository by:

- Deleting 4 merged branches:
  - `feature/ai-insights-20250502`
  - `feature/cleanup-merged-branches-and-open-prs-20250502-163521`
  - `feature/read-start-here-md-and-create-next-pr-20250502-161039`
  - `fix/pr-labeling`

- Preserving 3 important branches:
  - `feature/cleanup-merged-branches-20250502-182209` (current branch)
  - `main`
  - `feature/verify-start-here-md-and-resolve-issues-20250502-170718` (potential WIP)

## Future Recommendations

1. Run branch cleanup regularly to prevent accumulation of stale branches
2. Consider integrating the cleanup script into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically clean up branches after PRs are merged
3. Update the `efficient_cleanup.sh` script as needed to handle new branch patterns or special cases

A detailed report of the cleanup operation can be found in `CLEANUP_REPORT.md`.
