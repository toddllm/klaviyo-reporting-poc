# START-HERE.md Confirmation

I have read and understood the START-HERE.md file and the Narrow Scope POC PR Plan.

Based on my analysis:

1. PR 1 (Klaviyo API Ingest Script) has already been implemented
2. PR 2 (LookML Field Mapper) is the next PR to be implemented

I will proceed with implementing PR 2 using the branch name "feature/lookml-field-mapper" as specified in the PR plan.
