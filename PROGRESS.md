## How to Use This File

1. Before starting work on a PR, check this file to see which PR should be implemented next (the first one with "Not Started" status).
2. When you start working on a PR, update its status to "In Progress" and add your branch name.
3. When you complete a PR, update its status to "Completed", add the PR link, and ensure the branch name is correct.

## Repository Cleanup Guidelines

To maintain a clean repository state:

1. After a PR is merged, the feature branch should be deleted both locally and remotely
2. Before starting work on a new PR, ensure you're working from a clean main branch
3. Only one feature branch should exist at a time (the one you're actively working on)
4. If you find multiple feature branches, clean them up before starting new work

## Next Steps

The next PR to implement is **PR2: LookML Field Mapper**.
